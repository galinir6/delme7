        <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is
            marked
            with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black
            tear-like
            facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between
            1.1
            and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the
            fastest
            land animal, capable of running at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations
            for
            speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.</p>

        <img src="shark.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill
            slits
            on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified
            within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin).

        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
            Also
            called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the
            dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by humans.
            Hunter-gatherers did this, over 15,000 years ago in Germany,[7] which was before the development of
            agriculture.</p>
